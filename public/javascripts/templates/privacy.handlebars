<h1>privacy policy</h1>
<h3>what information do we collect?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>you give it to us or give us permission:</strong>&nbsp;when you post a secret or use the Product, you voluntarily give snapsecret information. This can include your twitter account name, email address, post content and any other information you provide us. If you’re using snapsecret on your mobile device, you can also choose to provide us with location data.</li>
  <li><strong>log data:</strong>&nbsp;when you use snapsecret, our servers automatically record information (“log data”) including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you’re using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used snapsecret, and cookie data.</li>
  <li><strong>cookie data:</strong>&nbsp;depending on how you’re accessing our products, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your snapsecret account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other snapsecret settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit snapsecret. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your snapsecret account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not.</li>
  <li><strong>device information:</strong>&nbsp;in addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you’re using snapsecret on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</li>
</ul>
<h3>how do we use the information we collect?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>we use the information we collect to provide our products to you and make them better, develop new products, and protect snapsecret and our users. For example, we may log how often people use two different versions of a product, which can help us understand which version is better.</li>
  <li>showing you ads you might be interest in.</li>
</ul>
<h3>how do we share the information we collect?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>when we have your consent. This includes sharing information with other services (like Facebook or Twitter) when you’ve chosen to link to your snapsecret account to those services or publish your activity on snapsecret to them. For example, you can choose to publish your secrets to Facebook or Twitter.</li>
  <li>if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or snapsecret; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>
  <li>we may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our partners or others. For example, we may tell a business using snapsecret how many people repinned something they shared, or the percentage of people who click a on pin after viewing it.</li>
